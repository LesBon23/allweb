    "descriptiontwo": "Dr. Shaina Mehra is a psychiatrist living in Warsaw, Poland. Her father Brijesh brings a marriage proposal and asks her to meet police officer Himanshu Tyagi, who is the son of a friend of Brijesh. The two meet in a train, where Shaina reveals she had an ex-boyfriend Devi Lal Singh, and talks about her crazy experiences with him. Devi is shown to be intelligent and adventurous, always looking for a kick in his life. Shaina was helping her friend, Vidhi elope with Devi's friend, Jignesh, when she met Devi in Delhi. After a long, hilarious chase, Devi got Vidhi and Jignesh married in a temple, but also helped Vidhi's mother reach the temple for a kick. Shaina met Devi's family; the two began dating and fall in love. On her suggestion and getting ashamed from her father, Devi got a job in a chemical lab but resigned soon, suffering from the lack of a kick. Devi tried hiding from Shaina that he is jobless again but she soon discovered it. Shaina scolded him for not being able to earn money, and Devi broke up with her and said that his new kick is now to earn money. She has since shifted to Warsaw, having to entertain Brijesh and his desire to see her married.",
    "descriptionThree": "Himanshu shares his experiences with a thief he hates as he cannot stop him; the robber, Devil, has been targeting the rich people associated with corrupt businessman Shiv Gajra, and is robbing them. Devil is actually Devi. As Himanshu fails in catching Devil, Devi contacts him and insults him by calling him a loser, which is a clue that Devi gives Himanshu. While with Himanshu in Warsaw, Shaina spots Devi who is there for treatment after losing his memory in an accident. She offers to handle Devi's case, which was referred by Dr. Jayant Verma, and take him home. However, Devi is in fact faking his memory loss; his real plan is to befriend and fool Himanshu and rob Shiv, who will come to Poland. Devi enters a charity function and robs Shiv, but Himanshu and Shaina discover the truth and Devi is ultimately forced to drown himself. However, he escapes.\n\nDevi's true intentions and good deeds are revealed by his father Ratan Lal in a flashback. He tells Shaina that Devi is committing robberies to help poor children who are battling diseases. Devi saved a girl, Jhumki after reading a letter in the hands of her dead parents, and got the most powerful kick when she smiled at him. When Dr. Verma told him that several such children are battling diseases, he decided to save them by robbing to get money for their treatments, knowing that it will give a lot of Kick. Back in the present, Himanshu tracks Devi down to a bar in Delhi and warns him he will be killed if he robs again, but Devi says he will rob a huge party fund on 14 November. He dares Himanshu to kill him on the 14th, otherwise, Devi will be standing in front of him on 15 November and he won't be able to do anything.\n\nOn 14 November, after fighting Shiv's henchmen and robbing the money, Devi kills him. Himanshu is set up with officers to shoot Devi, but several kids block his shot. Himanshu realizes the robberies were for the kids after a teacher informs him that the children are going to pray for their saviour and its Children's Day today. On 15 November, Devi joins the police force. He arrives at the police station and stands in front of Himanshu, who is unable to do anything about the situation, therefore completing his challenge. Himanshu is taken off of the case and it is given to Devi, who is now a police officer. Devi then thanks Himanshu, saying that he was never against him, but he is against the corrupt system.",
